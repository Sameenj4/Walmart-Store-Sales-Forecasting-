Walmart Store Sales Forecasting
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast Walmart’s weekly store sales using historical sales data combined with external factors such as holidays, promotions, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment, and markdown events. The forecasting helps optimize inventory management, staffing, supply chain efficiency, and strategic decision-making.

📂 Dataset

Unemployment rates

Weather impact

⚙️ Methodology

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handling missing values, feature encoding, and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, seasonality, and holiday impacts.

Feature Engineering – Creating meaningful features to improve predictive power.

Model Building – Implementing and comparing multiple models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Neural Network

Evaluation Metrics – Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score used for model comparison.

📊 Results

Models successfully capture seasonal and promotional effects on sales.

Random Forest and XGBoost showed higher accuracy compared to linear models.

Forecasting insights enable better planning of stock levels and resource allocation.

🚀 Key Outcomes
