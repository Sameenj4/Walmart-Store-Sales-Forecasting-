Walmart Sales Analysis & Forecasting
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart’s historical sales data and builds forecasting models to predict weekly store sales. The notebook (Walmart Sales Analysis.ipynb) includes data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation. By incorporating external factors such as holidays, promotions, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment, the project demonstrates how data-driven forecasting can improve retail decision-making.

📂 Files in Repository

Walmart Sales Analysis.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, analysis, and forecasting models.

requirements.txt – Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

README.md – Project documentation.

⚙️ Workflow

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Sales trends, holiday effects, and external factor analysis.

Model Implementation – Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks.

Evaluation Metrics – Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Visualization – Sales trends, predictions vs. actuals, and feature impacts.

📊 Results

Identified key drivers of Walmart sales (holidays, markdowns, economy indicators).

Random Forest and XGBoost provided better accuracy compared to linear models.

Forecasting results highlight potential for improved inventory planning and staffing.
